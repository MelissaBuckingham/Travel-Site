# Trollheim Travel Site

## Description

The purpose of this site is to provide prospective tourists and visitors the main highlights of our wonderful counrtry. And to convince them to come here rather than to any other mythical realm to which they might be considering.   

- I wanted to create this website which combines two of my passions: Travel and Fantasy.

- I built this website in order to showcase what I have learned so far through my level 5 diploma in Coding
- Troughout this project so far I have grown in confidence and feel like I can easily build a website from scratch , something  I previously did not feel capable to do.
- From studying the course material and other resources on the web, I have learned lots of different ways to get the ideas dfrom my head in to the code of my wensite. It's been a thrilling ride!

 

## UX design

I wanted to make the user experience as easy to use but at the same time making the website unique and interesting to use. 

## Bugs and Testing

Tested all html and css files against jigsaw w3c tools online.

I had a problem trying to get the Youtube image to show. I fixed the issue by using the unicode symbol, which seems to work. not sure it's perfectly acceptable practice but if it works it works...

## Credits

I used the Love Running project for inspiration including the hero image inclusion and the responsiveness on smaler screened devices.

I drew inspiration from nicepage.com for ways to create the testimonials section on the main page.
